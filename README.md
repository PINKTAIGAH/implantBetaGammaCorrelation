# implantBetaGammaCorrelation
Repository used to correlate implantations to beta decays and gamma decays in the G302 experiment at GSI

Branch "18_03_stable" contains the repository as it was without any changes since 1PM 18.03 (prior to the AIDA meeting). Clone this branch when performing analysis on other datasets to get comparable results to those shown in the AIDA meeting on 18.03.

Branch "workingGammas" contains the repository where ionbeta.C can successfully match implants to betas and matched betas to gammas. The prompt window for gamma spectra needs to be refined; therefore, expect to see a larger signal-to-background ratio.
